<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >Some of the most important problems of the calculus are those where time is the
independent variable, and we have to think about the values of some other quantity
that varies when the time varies. Some things grow larger as time goes on; some
other things grow smaller. The distance that a train has got from its starting place
goes on ever increasing as time goes on. Trees grow taller as the years go by.
Which is growing at the greater rate; a plant <script type="math/tex">12</script> inches high which in one month
becomes <script type="math/tex">14</script> inches high, or a tree <script type="math/tex">12</script> feet high which in a year becomes <script type="math/tex">14</script> feet
high?
</p><!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >In this chapter we are going to make much use of the word rate. Nothing to do with
poor-rate, or water-rate (except that even here the word suggests a proportion-a
ratio-so many pence in the pound). Nothing to do even with birth-rate or death-rate,
though these words suggest so many births or deaths per thousand of the population.
When a motor-car whizzes by us, we say: What a terrific rate! When a spendthrift is
flinging about his money, we remark that that young man is living at a prodigious
rate.
</p><!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >What do we mean by rate? In both these cases we are making a mental comparison
of something that is happening, and the length of time that it takes to happen. If the
motor-car flies past us going <script type="math/tex">10</script> yards per second, a simple bit of mental arithmetic will
show us that this is equivalent-while it lasts-to a rate of <script type="math/tex">600</script> yards per minute, or over <script type="math/tex">20</script>
miles per hour.
</p><!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >Now in what sense is it true that a speed of <script type="math/tex">10</script> yards per second is the same as <script type="math/tex">600</script> yards
per minute? Ten yards is not the same as <script type="math/tex">600</script> yards, nor is one second the same thing as
one minute. What we mean by saying that the rate is the same, is this: that the
proportion borne between distance passed over and time taken to pass over it, is the
same in both cases.
</p><!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >Take another example. A man may have only a few pounds in his possession, and yet
be able to spend money at the rate of millions a year-provided he goes on spending
money at that rate for a few minutes only. Suppose you hand a shilling
over the counter to pay for some goods; and suppose the operation lasts
exactly one second. Then, during that brief operation, you are parting with
your money at the rate of <script type="math/tex">1</script> shilling per second, which is the same rate as <script type="math/tex">\pounds </script><script type="math/tex">3</script>
per minute, or <script type="math/tex">\pounds </script><script type="math/tex">180</script> per hour, or <script type="math/tex">\pounds </script><script type="math/tex">4320</script> per day, or <script type="math/tex">\pounds </script><script type="math/tex">1,576,800</script> per year! If you have <script type="math/tex">\pounds </script><script type="math/tex">10</script> in your
pocket, you can go on spending money at the rate of a million a year for just <script type="math/tex">5\frac {1}{4}</script>
minutes.
</p><!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >It is said that Sandy had not been in London
</p><!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >above five minutes when ”bang went saxpence.” If he were to spend money at that
                                                                  

                                                                  
rate all day long, say for <script type="math/tex">12</script> hours, he would be spending <script type="math/tex">6</script> shillings
</p><!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >an hour, or <script type="math/tex">\pounds </script><script type="math/tex">3</script>. <script type="math/tex">12</script>s . per day, or <script type="math/tex">\pounds </script><script type="math/tex">21</script>. <script type="math/tex">12</script>s . a week, not counting the Sabbath.
</p><!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >Now try to put some of these ideas into differential notation.
</p><!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >Let <script type="math/tex">y</script> in this case stand for money, and let <script type="math/tex">t</script> stand for time.
</p><!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >If you are spending money, and the amount you spend in a short time <script type="math/tex">dt</script> be
called <script type="math/tex">dy</script>, the rate of spending it will be <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {dy}{dt}</script>, or rather, should be written with a
minus sign, as <script type="math/tex">-\dfrac {dy}{dt}</script>, because <script type="math/tex">dy</script> is a decrement, not an increment. But money is
not a good example for the calculus, because it generally comes and goes
by jumps, not by a continuous flow-you may earn <script type="math/tex">\pounds </script><script type="math/tex">200</script> a year, but it does not
keep running in all day long in a thin stream; it comes in only weekly, or
monthly, or quarterly, in lumps: and your expenditure also goes out in sudden
payments.
</p><!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >A more apt illustration of the idea of a rate is furnished by the speed of a
moving body. From London (Euston station) to Liverpool is <script type="math/tex">200</script> miles. If a
train leaves London at <script type="math/tex">7</script> o’clock, and reaches Liverpool at <script type="math/tex">11</script> o’clock, you know
that, since it has travelled <script type="math/tex">200</script> miles in <script type="math/tex">4</script> hours, its average rate must have been <script type="math/tex">50</script>
miles per hour; because <script type="math/tex">\frac {200}{4} = \frac {50}{1}</script>. Here you are really making a mental comparison
between
</p><!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" >the distance passed over and the time taken to pass over it. You are dividing one by
the other. If <script type="math/tex">y</script> is the whole distance, and <script type="math/tex">t</script> the whole time, clearly the average rate
is <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {y}{t}</script>. Now the speed was not actually constant all the way: at starting, and
during the slowing up at the end of the journey, the speed was less. Probably
at some part, when running downhill, the speed was over <script type="math/tex">60</script> miles an hour.
If, during any particular element of time <script type="math/tex">dt</script>, the corresponding element of
distance passed over was <script type="math/tex">dy</script>, then at that part of the journey the speed was <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {dy}{dt}</script>. The
rate at which one quantity (in the present instance, distance) is changing in
relation to the other quantity (in this case, time) is properly expressed, then,
by stating the differential coefficient of one with respect to the other. A
velocity, scientifically expressed, is the rate at which a very small distance
in any given direction is being passed over; and may therefore be written
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> v = \dfrac {dy}{dt}. </script>
</p><!--l. 126--><p class="noindent" >But if the velocity <script type="math/tex">v</script> is not uniform, then it must be either increasing or else
decreasing. The rate at which a velocity is increasing is called the acceleration. If a
moving body is, at any particular instant, gaining an additional velocity <script type="math/tex">dv</script> in
an element of time <script type="math/tex">dt</script>, then the acceleration <script type="math/tex">a</script> at that instant may be written
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> a = \dfrac {dv}{dt}; </script>
</p><!--l. 136--><p class="noindent" >but <script type="math/tex">dv</script> is itself <script type="math/tex">d\left ( \dfrac {dy}{dt} \right )</script>. Hence we may put <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> a = \frac {d\left ( \dfrac {dy}{dt} \right )}{dt}; </script> and this is usually written <script type="math/tex">a = \dfrac {d^2y}{dt^2}</script>; or the acceleration is
the second differential coefficient of the distance, with respect to time. Acceleration is
expressed as a change of velocity in unit time, for instance, as being so many feet per
second per second; the notation used being <script type="math/tex">\text {feet} \div \text {second}^2</script>.
</p><!--l. 147--><p class="noindent" >When a railway train has just begun to move, its velocity <script type="math/tex">v</script> is small; but it is rapidly
gaining speed-it is being hurried up, or accelerated, by the effort of the engine. So its <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {d^2y}{dt^2}</script>
                                                                  

                                                                  
is large. When it has got up its top speed it is no longer being accelerated, so that
then <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {d^2y}{dt^2}</script> has fallen to zero. But when it nears its stopping place its speed begins to slow
down; may, indeed, slow down very quickly if the brakes are put on, and during this
period of deceleration or slackening of pace, the value of <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {dv}{dt}</script>, that is, of <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {d^2y}{dt^2}</script> will be
negative.
</p><!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >To accelerate a mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> requires the continuous application of force. The force necessary
to accelerate a mass is proportional to the mass, and it is also proportional to the
acceleration which is being imparted. Hence we may write for the force <script type="math/tex">f</script>, the
expression </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{align} 
f &= ma \\
 \text{or}\\ f &= m \frac{dv}{dt}
 \text{or}\\ f &= m \frac{d^2y}{dt^2}
\end{align}</script>
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >The product of a mass by the speed at which it is going is called its momentum, and
is in symbols <script type="math/tex">mv</script>. If we differentiate momentum with respect to time we shall get <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {d(mv)}{dt}</script> for
the rate of change of momentum. But, since <script type="math/tex">m</script> is a constant quantity, this
may be written <script type="math/tex">m \dfrac {dv}{dt}</script>, which we see above is the same as <script type="math/tex">f</script>. That is to say, force
may be expressed either as mass times acceleration, or as rate of change of
momentum.
</p><!--l. 180--><p class="noindent" >Again, if a force is employed to move something (against an equal and opposite
counter-force), it does work; and the amount of work done is measured by the
product of the force into the distance (in its own direction) through which its point of
application moves forward. So if a force <script type="math/tex">f</script> moves forward through a length <script type="math/tex">y</script>, the work
done (which we may call <script type="math/tex">w</script>) will be
</p><!--l. 189--><p class="noindent" ><script type="math/tex">w = f * y</script>
</p><!--l. 191--><p class="noindent" >where we take <script type="math/tex">f</script> as a constant force. If the force varies at different parts of the
range <script type="math/tex">y</script>, then we must find an expression for its value from point to point. If <script type="math/tex">f</script>
be the force along the small element of length <script type="math/tex">dy</script>, the amount of work done
will be <script type="math/tex">f * dy</script>. But as <script type="math/tex">dy</script> is only an element of length, only an element of work will
be done. If we write <script type="math/tex">w</script> for work, then an element of work will be <script type="math/tex">dw</script>; and we
have
</p><!--l. 200--><p class="noindent" ><script type="math/tex">dw = f * dy</script>
</p><!--l. 203--><p class="noindent" >which may be written
</p><!--l. 205--><p class="noindent" ><script type="math/tex">dw = ma*dy \text { or} dw = m \frac {d^2y}{dt^2}* dy \text {or} dw = m \frac {dv}{dt}* dy</script>
</p><!--l. 211--><p class="noindent" >Further, we may transpose the expression and write
</p><!--l. 213--><p class="noindent" ><script type="math/tex">\frac {dw}{dy} = f</script>.
</p><!--l. 216--><p class="noindent" >This gives us yet a third definition of force; that if it is being used to produce a
displacement in any direction, the force (in that direction) is equal to the rate at
which work is being done per unit of length in that direction. In this last sentence the
word rate is clearly not used in its time-sense, but in its meaning as ratio or
                                                                  

                                                                  
proportion.
</p><!--l. 224--><p class="noindent" >Sir Isaac Newton, who was (along with Leibniz) an inventor of the methods of the
calculus, regarded all quantities that were varying as flowing; and the ratio which we
nowadays call the differential coefficient he regarded as the rate of flowing, or the
fluxion of the quantity in question. He did not use the notation of the <script type="math/tex">dy</script> and <script type="math/tex">dx</script>, and <script type="math/tex">dt</script>
(this was due to Leibnitz), but had instead a notation of his own. If <script type="math/tex">y</script> was a quantity
that varied, or ”flowed,” then his symbol for its rate of variation (or ”fluxion”)
was
</p><!--l. 235--><p class="noindent" ><script type="math/tex">\dot {y}</script>. If <script type="math/tex">x</script> was the variable, then its fluxion was called <script type="math/tex">\dot {x}</script>. The dot over the letter indicated
that it had been differentiated. But this notation does not tell us what is
the independent variable with respect to which the differentiation has been
effected. When we see <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {dy}{dt}</script> we know that <script type="math/tex">y</script> is to be differentiated with respect
to <script type="math/tex">t</script>. If we see <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {dy}{dx}</script> we know that <script type="math/tex">y</script> is to be differentiated with respect to <script type="math/tex">x</script>. But
if we see merely <script type="math/tex">\dot {y}</script>, we cannot tell without looking at the context whether
this is to mean <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {dy}{dx}</script> or <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {dy}{dt}</script> or <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {dy}{dz}</script>, or what is the other variable. So, therefore, this
fluxional notation is less informing than the differential notation, and has in
consequence largely dropped out of use. But its simplicity gives it an advantage if
only we will agree to use it for those cases exclusively where time is the
independent variable. In that case <script type="math/tex">\dot {y}</script> will mean <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {dy}{dt}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\dot {u}</script> will mean <script type="math/tex">\dfrac {du}{dt}</script>; and <script type="math/tex">\ddot {x}</script> will mean
<script type="math/tex">\dfrac {d^2x}{dt^2}</script>.
</p><!--l. 254--><p class="noindent" >Adopting this fluxional notation we may write the mechanical equations considered
in the paragraphs above, as follows:
